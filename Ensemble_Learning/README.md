Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model.

The fundamental principle of the ensemble model is that a group of weak learners come together to form a strong learner, which increases the accuracy of the model. 

Parallel Ensemble Learning(bagging) :  

Algorithms : Random Forest, Bagged Decision Trees, Extra Trees

Sequential Ensembling Learning : 

Example : Adaboost, Stochastic Gradient Boosting
